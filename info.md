# Home Assistant Tapo for P105 Integration

This is a custom integration to control tapo P105 devices for home assistant.
This integration powered by [TP-LINK Tapo P105/P110M support Klap protocol](https://lab.sasapea.mydns.jp/2023/12/24/tapo_klap_pc/).
Thank you for [researcher](https://lab.sasapea.mydns.jp/)'s work.

There was already a great plug-in called [home-assistant-tapo-p100](https://github.com/petretiandrea/home-assistant-tapo-p100), but it didnâ€™t work with the P105. So, I created this integration as a part of my studies.
